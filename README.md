# My-Experience-through-C-Standard
This Repository was created to keep track of my progress through my programming lessons with C along as starting to use GitHub as a whole.

Updates will come most likely by the end of the day, and they will still be subject to change.

They will be divided by Semester, then the corresponding Unit. First times will include the 'Function' or 'Subroutine I will be introducted to.

Until I clear out the details of these programs as well as GitHub's workflow you will see sloppiness through everything.
